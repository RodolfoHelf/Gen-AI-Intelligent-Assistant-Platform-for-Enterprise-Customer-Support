# 🤖 Gen-AI Assistant Platform for Enterprise Support

Welcome to the **Gen-AI Assistant**, an intelligent customer service platform powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and multi-agent orchestration. This project simulates a production-ready pipeline for building AI assistants capable of handling customer support queries with contextual awareness, structured reasoning, and cloud scalability.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was built to demonstrate the core technical competencies required for a **Senior Data Scientist / AI Engineer** role, focusing on:

- Generative AI & LLM integration (OpenAI API)
- Agent-based architecture using LangChain
- Data ingestion, cleaning & orchestration
- Classical ML models for auxiliary tasks
- Cloud-friendly design with monitoring dashboards

## 📊 Example Use Case

> **Input**:  
> “My connected BMW device isn’t syncing with the cloud. What should I do?”

> **Output** (via LLM agent):  
> A contextual, helpful response extracted from a simulated knowledge base using prompt engineering and multi-agent reasoning.
